# Stress_level_prediction
This is a machine learning model used to predict under which stress level you fall under taking in parameters like your respiration rate, body temprature etc.
I have used pandas for data cleaning and eda, Matplotlib & Seaborn for ploting graphs and scikit learn for modeling and validating the models.
